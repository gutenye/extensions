This extension is highly inspired by [Ethereum Price](https://www.raycast.com/peduarte/ethereum-price#readme).

Custom Display Style

- `100 $1,234 200`: in `down price up` format, down is `CurrentPrice - LowestPriceIn24Hours`, up is `HighestPriceIn24Hours - CurrentPrice`
- `1% $1,234 2%`: in `down price up` format, but in percentage
